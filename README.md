# ATD-Final-Project 

## Introduction
For the time being, billions of users use Twitter, generating more than 12 Terabytes of data daily since 2018. In recent years, many fields such as business, industries, governments, as well as scientists have been leveraging this vast amount of non-structured data producing intriguing investigations and helpful results to comprehend social interactions patterns between the users of the app.

## Objectives
Utilizing web scraping, API of Twitter, NLP (Natural Language Processing) technics, and Python library Flask to provide a prototype of API which comprises an amicable environment for users (who speak English and/or Spanish) who are interested in analyzing social interactions patterns regarding distinct trending topics and social profile of whichever users in Twitter, regardless of the language. The output will be an object JSON or XML (using Python or Browser).

Another additional aim that we have is to provide another API with the functions and methods of DRAE (Dictionary of Spanish Real Academy) which currently does not exist in Python. For example, we can translate and acquire the words' definitions of different languages. With this API, we seek to enrich the results obtained from Twitter information analysis (e.g. translate, obtain the definitions, etc.), adding as additional elements of JSON/XML objects.


For this work, we created two APIs: (1) API of DRAE, and (2) API of Twitter analysis. In file `Twitter_Analysis_API.ipynb` describes the codes of Twitter Analysis API and in the file `DRAE_API.ipynb` describes the codes of DRAE API. To see practical examples with Python codes, please view the tutorials `Twitter_Analysis.ipynb` and `DRAE_Tutorial.ipynb`.

### This is only a prototype version, still need many refinement.

The descriptions of the available files:

Twitter_Analysis_API.py --> Codes of Tweeter Analysis (TA) API

Twitter_Analysis.ipynb --> Tutorial of parsing data from the TA API in Jupyter Notebook format
